This is Take the Emulator and Run!, previously hosted on BerliOS at
http://ttear.berlios.de/. BerliOS is shutting down by the end of 2011, so I
decided to migrate it here.

For the time being, this project is discontinued. I plan to eventually reboot
this project, but right now I simply don't have time for that. If you want to
hack on it, I encourage you to fork it. You might want to contact me first, as
I have some ideas for the project you might want to hear:
